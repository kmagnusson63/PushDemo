Push Demo using Google Cloud Messaging
By Ken Magnusson

To use this demo, first follow directions at:

http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/gs.html

You will need Project ID and API Key for Server from Google Developer Site.

To save Device registration id's into a database you can use this table schema:

CREATE TABLE `android_devices` (
  `id` int(16) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `registration_id` varchar(512) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `registration_id` (`registration_id`),
)

In the push_demo.php file, change the database details to your database settings.

Change the GOOGLE_KEY constant to your API key from the Google Developer site.
Upload the push_demo.php file to a webserver(haven't tried a local XAMPP server, but that should work as well)

After importing the project into Android studio, change the following:

In PushDemo.java
Line 33: Change PROJECT_ID to your project ID from Google developer.
Line 34: Change PUSH_SERVER to your webserver location where you uploaded push_demo.php

Run app.

To change text message sent from device, edit string at line 167 in PushDemo.java.
